    <h1>Abstract Factory Pattern</h1>
    <p>Use Abstract Factory when code needs to work with 
        various families of related products without tight 
        coupling to the actual concrete classes, because they 
        are either unknown at the time or may be expanded in the future
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, we're working with factories of first responders.
        So far there are Police and Firemen. We can also add Medical teams, 
        or other teams that follow the same structure. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Things needed for the Abstract Factory:
        <ol>
            <li>Explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct piece 
                of the item family (so Chief, Lieutenant, UnitMember)</li>
                <li>Make all variants of pieces that follow those interfaces</li>
                <li>Declare an abstract Factory (ResponderFactory)
                    with methods to create all items in the family 
                    (Chief, Lieutenant, UnitMember)
                </li>
                <li>Declare a separate factory class for each type of ResponderFactory
                    And no mixing and matching! 
                </li>
        </ol>

# software-design-patterns

A repository that I use to generate code samples for the Design Patterns ASP.Net Core web site. All samples are developed using TypeScript (a reason to learn TypeScript, actually).

Script to compile a sample in VS Code terminal:
tsc file_name.ts

Running a sample in VS Code terminal:
node file_name.js

If for any reason "tsc file_name.ts" is giving you issues, try 

tsc.cmd file_name.ts

And make sure when you run the "node file_name.js" command, you're actually feeding it the .js file, not .ts.
